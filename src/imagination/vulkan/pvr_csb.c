 * \brief Contains functions to manage Control Stream Builder (csb) object.
 *
 * A csb object can be used to create a primary/main control stream, referred
 * as control stream hereafter, or a secondary control stream, also referred as
 * a sub control stream. The main difference between these is that, the control
 * stream is the one directly submitted to the GPU and is terminated using
 * STREAM_TERMINATE. Whereas, the secondary control stream can be thought of as
 * an independent set of commands that can be referenced by a primary control
 * stream to avoid duplication and is instead terminated using STREAM_RETURN,
 * which means the control stream parser should return to the main stream it
 * came from.
 *
 * Note: Sub control stream is only supported for PVR_CMD_STREAM_TYPE_GRAPHICS
 * type control streams.
