# ail

ail is a small library for working with the image (and buffer) layouts
encountered with AGX hardware. Its design is inspired by isl. In
particular, ail strives to use isl unit suffixes and to represent
quantities in a canonical, API-agnostic fashion.

See the isl documentation for conventions in mesa/docs/isl for the conventions
that ail tries to adhere to, in particular mesa/docs/isl/units.rst.
